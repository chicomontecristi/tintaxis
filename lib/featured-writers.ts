    photo: "/writers/rosalva-flores-aleman.jpg",
    origin: "Sonora, México · Tucson, AZ",
    genre: "Literary Scholarship · Latin American Fiction",
    shortBio:
      "A scholar and writer whose work moves between 19th-century Latin American literature and the living questions of cultural identity, performance, and what it means to belong. She writes and teaches in Spanish and English — often at the same time.",
    fullBio:
      "Rosalva Flores-Alemán holds a Ph.D. in Literature from the University of Arizona (2022), where her research centered on 19th- and 20th-century Latin American literature, cultural studies, and the intersections of performance and subalternity. She is a native speaker of Spanish who has spent her academic career at the boundary between languages — teaching Spanish as a foreign language, working with Heritage Speakers recovering their own tongue, and building fully online courses that make rigorous literary study available to students who cannot reach a classroom. She has served as an academic advisor for Spanish Majors and Minors and as a Study Abroad advisor, personally recruiting and leading 33 students to Spain in 2021 and helping rescue a Costa Rica program from cancellation. Her pedagogy is built around first-generation students: active learning, critical thinking, and the conviction that literature is not a luxury but a tool. She writes with the same precision she demands in the classroom.",

      "José La Luz is a Dominican political figure, intellectual, and writer whose work spans more than three decades of engagement with Caribbean politics, social development, and the lives of ordinary people. His writing draws from direct experience inside the institutions and movements that have shaped the Dominican Republic. He writes in Spanish — plainly, precisely, and without detachment. His essays are not commentary from the outside. They are testimony.",

      "A writer and painter from the South Bronx by way of Santiago. His prose moves between English and Spanish, between the clinical and the violent, between grief and black humor.",
    fullBio:
      "Chico Montecristi was born in Santiago, Dominican Republic, and raised on Fulton Avenue in the South Bronx. He holds a B.S. in Public Health and an M.S.Ed. in Spanish Education from the University of Rochester, where he lived for thirteen years before moving west. He writes in English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. His debut novella, The Hunt, is a dark psychological thriller set in a small Colorado town — a story of a child who killed her mother and the father who covered it up. His second manuscript, Recoleta, is a Spanish-language novella dedicated to all mothers. He is also an oil painter, working in expressionist figurative portraiture with unconventional surfaces — found wood, wire mesh, dried flowers, fabric. His visual work has been exhibited in Tucson and Phoenix. He currently lives in Yuma, Arizona.",
